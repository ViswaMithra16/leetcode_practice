## 🔥 Problems by Data Structure / Pattern

### 🧮 Arrays & Hashing 

| # | Problem | Solution | Basic idea |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Two Sum | [Java](./arrays/two-sum/Solution.java) | HashMap to track complements in O(n). |
| 2 | Contains Duplicate | [Java](./arrays/contains-duplicate/Solution.java) | Use HashSet to detect duplicates. |
| 3 | Product of Array Except Self | [Java](./arrays/product-of-array-except-self/Solution.java) | Prefix & suffix product without division. |
| 4 | Maximum Subarray | [Java](./arrays/maximum-subarray/Solution.java) | Kadane’s algorithm for max sum subarray. |
| 5 | Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock | [Java](./arrays/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/Solution.java) | Track minimum price so far. |

### 🪟 Sliding Window 

| # | Problem | Solution | Basic idea |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters | [Java](./sliding-window/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/Solution.java) | Expand window, move left on duplicate. |
| 2 | Minimum Window Substring | [Java](./sliding-window/minimum-window-substring/Solution.java) | Frequency map + shrinking window. |
| 3 | Longest Repeating Character Replacement | [Java](./sliding-window/longest-repeating-character-replacement/Solution.java) | Window size − maxFreq ≤ k. |

### 👉 Two Pointers 

| # | Problem | Solution | Basic idea |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Valid Palindrome | [Java](./two-pointers/valid-palindrome/Solution.java) | Move pointers inward skipping non-alphanumerics. |
| 2 | Container With Most Water | [Java](./two-pointers/container-with-most-water/Solution.java) | Move smaller height pointer inward. |

---

### 📚 Stack

| # | Problem | Solution | Basic idea |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Valid Parentheses | [Java](./stack/valid-parentheses/Solution.java) | Stack to match opening brackets. |
| 2 | Daily Temperatures | [Java](./stack/daily-temperatures/Solution.java) | Monotonic decreasing stack. |

---

### 🔍 Binary Search 

| # | Problem | Solution | Basic idea |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Binary Search | [Java](./binary-search/binary-search/Solution.java) | Classic left/right pointer narrowing. |
| 2 | Search in Rotated Sorted Array | [Java](./binary-search/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/Solution.java) | Binary search with sorted half detection. |
